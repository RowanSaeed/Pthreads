# pthreads

## Objectives
1. Introducing threads concepts and POSIX threads library.
2. Implementing popular algorithms as multi-threaded ones.

## Resources
- Learn about threads [here](<link_to_threads_resource>).
- Learn about POSIX threads [here](<link_to_posix_threads_resource>).
- Programming with threads:
  - [Threads in C - Part 1](<link_to_threads_part1>)
  - [Threads in C - Part 2](<link_to_threads_part2>)

## Problem Statement
It is required to implement two popular algorithms as multi-threaded ones:
1. **Matrix Multiplication:**
   - Compute each element of the output matrix in a thread.
   - Compute each row of the output matrix in a thread.
   - Read input matrices from a file.
   - Output the result matrices and elapsed time for each procedure.

2. **Merge Sort:**
   - Implement Merge Sort using pthreads.
   - Read input array from a file.
   - Output the sorted array.

## Deliverables
- Complete source code in TWO FILES commented thoroughly and clearly:
  - 1st filename: `ID-matrix.<extension>` (e.g., `7692-matrix.c`)
  - 2nd filename: `ID-sort.<extension>` (e.g., `7692-sort.c`)
